/**
 * Vitest per-file setup file (runs inside each forked worker).
 *
 * Unref's all active handles after each test file so the event loop can
 * drain naturally. For non-native test files this is sufficient to let
 * the fork exit. For LadybugDB test files, native C++ handles may not expose
 * .unref() — CI handles this via process isolation (one vitest invocation
 * per LadybugDB test file) so the OS reclaims everything on process exit.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: We do NOT import lbug-adapter here. Importing it would load
 * the native addon even in non-LadybugDB test files, registering persistent
 * handles that prevent the fork from exiting.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: We do NOT call process.exit() here. On Linux, process.exit()
 * triggers N-API destructor hooks in the LadybugDB native addon that segfault
 * (SIGSEGV), crashing the fork before it can send results back via IPC.
